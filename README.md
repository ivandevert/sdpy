## Spectral Decomposition in Python

File run order:
1) download_seismograms.ipynb (download & save waveforms in .mseed format)
2) compute_spec.ipynb (compute spectra and save with event and station header info in .spec format files)
3) spectral_decomposition.ipynb (apply spectral decomposition to compute source parameters)

Disclaimer: This set of programs is provided simply to be a starting point for spectral decomposition, and has not been peer reviewed or thoroughly tested for bugs. Some of the assumptions made are imprecise. Refer to published spectral decomposition papers for details on how to improve this very basic algorithm.
